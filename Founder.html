          <h4> Pedro Evangelista Llamas was born in Pagsanjan, Laguna on August 01, 1884.
            Both of his parents,<br> Gabriel Llamas and Eleutera Evangelista were born and raised in the same town too.
            <br>
            <br>
          He studied in St. Joseph Catholic School in Hongkong for two years and continued his education <br>in the United States where he received 
          his Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from<br>the University of Michigan.
            <br>
            <br>
          At the young age of 28, he married Josefa Gomez Francia on August 26, 1912 and was blessed with <br>nine children: Herminio, Guadalupe, Fidel, 
          Amor, Luis, Jose, Mario, Carlos, and Eva.
            <br>
            <br>
          At 32, he was elected Municipal President of Pagsanjan for four years (1916–1920). He declined to<br> be re-elected to the position, even when 
          the townspeople wanted him to continue on, due to his<br> health problems.
            <br>
            <br>
          In 1923, he founded the Pagsanjan Academy to serve and augment the lack of schools in his town. <br>Later on, he realized that there was also a 
          need for secondary schools. Children from Pagsanjan went <br>to Laguna High School in Sta. Cruz, Rural High in Los Banos or in Manila to further 
          their schooling.<br> However, no one went to Calamba, as there were no secondary schools there. This thought bore fruit <br>and thus, Laguna Institute 
          was established in 1930. The Laguna Institute flourished amidst the havoc <br>and strife of World War II. It closed down temporarily in 1945 and opened 
          its doors once again in 1950.
            <br>
            <br>
          Don Pedro Llamas died January 13, 1946 at the age of 61 due to a failing heart condition. His demise <br>was a great loss for his family and to the community. 
          Nevertheless, his love for the Filipinos of Laguna <br>continued on with the legacy he left with his heirs; and that is of humble servitude exemplified by<br> providing 
          quality education to the community. He envisioned educating the community and equipping <br>people to become leaders leading them into abundance.
